# Intan-RHD2000-interface-source-code
Trying to change the way the data is saved in the "format type per signal type" so the amplifier data will be saved in the same file with the auxiliary input data

Hi all,
I'm a Phd students that works with electrophtsilogy tools in freely moving rodents. 
I'm trying to change the way the data is saved in the Intan-RHD2000-interface-source-code so I'll be able to use it with the Neuroscope softwere. Intan has a fromat type that is adaptable by Neuroscope but it only saves one signal type per file. I want to save the amplifier data with the auxiliary input data on the same file.

I'm new to c++ and new to the QT platform and so I would appreciate any assistamce 

Amir
